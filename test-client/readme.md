Description of test system for nesting:
=======================================

TODO list:
==========
* Do not run nesting automatically after new test generation, instead of this add new button 'Run nesting' under 'Visualize test' button and horizontal separator.
* Generate colors for visualization randomly, but they should be different from each other
* Visualize server response by using the same colors as for gold response visualization
* ~~Rename 'Tests' page to 'Create' (just rename link for this "page")~~

Ideas:
======
* Add small buttons 'Test passed' and 'Test failed' (or just small buttons with icons, need to think about their design)
* Add 'import' block to 'Create' page. User selects an input file in some format (format like from https://paginas.fe.up.pt/~esicup/datasets?page=2 page), and a new test is created, without gold response.
* Add feature to rename test
